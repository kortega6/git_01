She sits by the window, spoon in hand,   
A bowl of warmth in a quiet land.   
Steam curls upward, soft and slow,   
As the evening sun begins to glow.   

Each sip, a dance of flavors new,   
Carrots, potatoes, a broth so true.  
The herbs whisper secrets of green,  
Like stories untold, serene, unseen.   

The soup hums softly, a song of the past,   
In every bite, memories cast.   
Her lips curl gently with each taste,   
No spoonful hurried, none in haste.   

The broth, a comfort, deep and kind,   
Warming her body, soothing her mind.  
Each swirl of the spoon, a quiet grace,  
A moment of stillness in her face.   

Outside, the world rushes by,  
But in her soup, time drifts like the sky.   
A meal so simple, yet rich in its glow,     
Like a secret garden where only she can go.     

And as the bowl empties, calm remains,   
A quiet joy she can't quite explain.   
For in that soup, so humble, so true,   
She found a peace that only she knew.
